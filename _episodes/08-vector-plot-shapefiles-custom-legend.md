This episode builds upon
[the previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r/)
to work with shapefile attributes in R and explores how to plot multiple
shapefiles. It also covers how to plot raster and vector data together
on the same plot.

## Load the Data

To work with vector data in R, we can use the `sf` library. The `raster`
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
raster and vector files. Make sure that you have these packages loaded.

We will continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode. The three shapefiles are:

- `aoi_boundary_HARV` layer of the "data/vector/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp"
- `lines_HARV` layer of the "data/vector/HARV_roads.shp"
- `point_HARV` layer of the "data/vector/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp"

## Plotting Multiple Shapefiles
In the [previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r/),
we learned how to plot information from a single shapefile and do
some plot customization including adding a custom legend. However,
what if we want to create a more complex plot with many shapefiles
and unique symbols that need to be represented clearly in a legend?

Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`),
site boundary (`aoi_boundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. We
will need to build a custom legend as well.

To begin, we will create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. Then layer
the tower location and road data on top using `+`.


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()

Now that we have a basic plot, we can customize it by changing the symbology, or the look of the data by changing the `fill` and the `color`. We will change the `aoi_boundary_HARV` to be solid gray. Because we want to show the different types of paths at this site, we will also have the color of the `lines_HARV` data be set according to the `TYPE` attribute. Doing this will also create a legend for our plot. And finally, because we also want to includ tower location in the legend, we will have the fill of the `point_HARV` data be set according to the `Sub_type` attribute. 


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type)) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()

{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-customize-layers-1.png" title="plot of chunk customize-layers" alt="plot of chunk customize-layers" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next, let's build a custom legend using the symbology (the colors and symbols) that we used to create the plot above. We will use `ggplot2` functions to specify the symbology and change the names of the legends. We will add lines for the `color` or the lines and the `fill` of the points. We will also adjust the legend titles by passing a `name` to the respective `color` and `fill` palettes. 


~~~
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, color = "gray", fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors, name = "Path Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location") +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-create-custom-legend-1.png" title="plot of chunk create-custom-legend" alt="plot of chunk create-custom-legend" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Finally, it might be better if the points were symbolized as a symbol. We can customize this using `shape` parameters in our call to `geom_sf`: 16 is a point symbol, 15 is a box.
